# J-Notifier
This small software was created with the intention of automatically remembering when a hotel should add their restaurant reservations to their clients.  In the program you can add, edit and delete notifications which will be executed 6 days before the estimated date.  Notifications will not stop ringing unless you add the reservation in the system.
